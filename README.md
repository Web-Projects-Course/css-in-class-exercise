# CSS in-class exercise

This is an exercise to get you familiar with CSS selectors and properties. 

We are using an excerpt of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein as our test HTML.

##Complete the following tasks:

* Make all the text a sans-serif font.
* Remove the underline from all the links.
* Make the title "Frankenstein" bigger
* Add a margin of 50px to the bottom of each paragraph. Make sure you add it only to the bottom.
* Make the subtitle ("or the Modern Prometheus") italics
* Make all the heading tags align to the right
* Transform all the h1 tags to uppercase
* Add a border to the top of the of each chapter
* Make the background of Chapter 2 yellow
* Make the chapter titles gray
* Make the byline bold
* Make the "Return to Table of Contents" links disappear
* Get rid of the bullets on the table of contents links list.

### Bonus
* Make it so when you hover each paragraph of the chapter the font size increases. Can you change the color of visited links from purple to something else?
* Make the first letter of paragraphs with in the chapters much bigger. Can you make just the first letter of the first paragraph of each chapter bigger?
